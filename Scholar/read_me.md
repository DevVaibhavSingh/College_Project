A little info about the project!

## Target users

EducaPedia is a web-application  where students, job-holders and professors meet and collaborate on Projects, Research Papers, Job Opportunities, Internships, Scholarships and more. The application also allows the users to anonymously post or submit the reviews for educational organizations and companies having more than 10 employees. 

The following are the target audience for EducaPedia:

Students: The students would be able to create accounts, post in community, find Job, Internship or Scholarship opportunities from various organizations and institutes. Students can search for mentors and contact them for any kind of assistance. This would help students to learn from the experiences of job holders and professors. The community allows the students to post their questions and get answers from the qualified personalities. 

Professors: Professors would be able to create accounts and post notification for their respective institutes. They can issue the notifications to the students of the respective batches and could even mentor them. 

Job Seekers: Job Seekers can create accounts to take the advantages of the features of the platform like Job Notification, Referral Programs, Mentoring, Higher Studies opportunities and much more. They can post or view the reviews of the organizations in which people of the platform have worked in. 

## Scope 
The platform acts as a bridge between students, professors, institutions and corporates, job-holders and jobseekers. The platform could be further developed to make startup collaborations and raise the funds from the community that is interested in the startup idea and wants to invest. 

There exists no such modern platform for such purposes where students, professors and jobholders collaborate to help bring a positive change in each otherâ€™s life. Looking at the scarcity of any such application on the Internet, EducaPedia could quickly adapt the rankings on the Google search engine with minimal marketing practices.
